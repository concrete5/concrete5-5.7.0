## Backward Compatibility Notes

* The user autocomplete quickSelect method now defaults to showing user avatars and including usernames and email addresses (if the site is configured to use usernames). This is likely desired for an administrative component but if you’re using quickSelect on the frontend you may wish to restrict this behavior. Consider modifying your usage of quickSelect to use the AUTO_MINIMUM constant and enable/disable user avatars as you like.
* Bootstrap Select has been deprecated. It is still shipping with Bedrock but will be removed in a subsequent version update. Update your code to use new Concrete select components instead.
* The encryption service (unused by the core) has been removed; there is no replacement built into the core but many third party libraries are available in packagist.
* The v-date-picker and v-calendar Vue components have been removed. They are attractive but they are simply too large to include in the JavaScript that powers Concrete. They have been replaced with native solutions. It is unlikely that you’ve included these components in custom code, but if you have you’ll need to import them into your JavaScript bundles yourself.
* The vue toggle Vue component has been removed. It was too large to include in the Concrete CMS JavaScript bundle. If you need this functionality use Bootstrap Switches, which are now included and available.

* Bedrock updated to 1.4, which includes support for Bootstrap 5.2 and many other updates.
* Numerous minor PHP dependency updates

## Backward Compatibility Notes

* The `Concrete\Core\Express\Form\Validator\Routine\RoutineInterface` class and all classes that implement it has changed. The `validate` method now takes a nullable third parameter for the `Concrete\Core\Entity\Express\Entry` object that may or may not exist. This replaces the request type attribute. The request type can now be inferred - if the entry does not exist, we assume this to be an `ADD` operation. If the entry exists within the `validate` method, you are running an `UPDATE` operation.
* Block::duplicate() has changed its secondary parameter from $isCopiedWhenPropagated to $controllerMethodToTryAndRun. This lets us choose `duplicate_master` or the new `duplicate_clipboard` in certain situations. It is very unlikely that this should impact any custom code you have written as this is pretty deep in the Concrete internals.
* If you have customized the Document Library view template, please ensure that your `<form>` tag has a valid input button with the name `”search”`. This is checked in the controller in order to ensure searching is actually occurring. If you want to search by advanced file attributes, you’ll need this to be in place or else the Document Library controller will not check for attribute searching.

This caused problems in the event response factory was used prior to sessions being available or being configured for database sessions that were not yet installed. This parameter has been removed. If you use the `$app->make()` method of building this class, you should not be affected.
* Now using https:// for communication with the Concrete marketplace even when the user’s site is not https://

## Developer Updates

* Badges and community points have been removed from the core. If you need this functionality, install the Community Badges add-on from
  https://github.com/concrete5/community_badges prior to upgrading your site.
* Concrete now runs on PHP 8.
* Tools have been completely removed, including from blocks and packages. Their functionality has been more securely and flexibly available with the routing and controller systems for many years now. (thanks mlocati!)
* Completely rebuilt new queue system, built on Symfony Messenger.
* Completely new command/message system, built on Symfony Messenger.
* Many core components updated to their latest version, including Laravel and Symfony components.
* Add overridable collection handle generator (thanks hissy)
* Removing old process.php script for backend requests.
* Introducing a new command bus pattern. Developers can use to encapsulate their commands, reusing them with one or two lines in multiple places.
* Swapped underlying HTTP client with Guzzle and PSR7.
* Router adds support for single action controllers with __invoke (thanks shahroq)
* Allow Form helper to handle new HTML input types (thanks JohnTheFish)
* https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/pull/9479 (thanks jeffPaetkau)
* Blacklist/whitelist terminology renamed throughout the core.

## Backward Compatibility Notes

* If you use `Core::make()`, `$app->make()` or anything similar in your packages, and provide arguments to these classes at the same time, recent updates to the Laravel Container class may break some older code. Please see this tutorial for more information: https://documentation.concretecms.org/tutorials/add-developers-get-your-add-ons-ready-concrete-cms-90
* Beginning in version 8, we added the ability to override core elements from within your themes. For example, if the core requires an element via `View::element(‘conversations/add_post’;` the core looks for this add-on in `concrete/elements/conversations/add_post.php`. However, if the currently active theme provides this element in `themes/my_theme/elements/concrete/conversations/add_post.php`, it will be used instead. We are changing this to remove the `concrete/` directory from the `elements` directory within your theme. That means in order to override any core element from within your theme, you only need to make it available at the same path within the `elements/` directory of your theme.
* If you register custom help for specific pages in your package, make sure to do so from within your package’s `on_start` method rather than from within the Dashboard page. Our new help panel requires this. See https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/9869#issuecomment-927136592 for more information.
* Console command `c5:blacklist:clear` has been renamed `c5:denylist:clear`
* If you work with Concrete cookies directly in your server configurations, be aware that they have been renamed. The default session cookie has been changed from CONCRETE5 to CONCRETE; the default is-logged-in cookie has been changed from CONCRETE5_LOGIN to CONCRETE_LOGIN.

## Security Fixes 

* CKEditor updated from 4.16.2 to 4.18.0 (thanks hissy)
* Remediated CVE-2022-21829 - Concrete CMS Version 9.0.2 and below and 8.5.7 and below can download zip files over HTTP and execute code from those zip files which could lead to an RCE. Fixed by enforcing ‘concrete_secure’ instead of ‘concrete’. Concrete now only makes requests over https even if a request comes in via http. Concrete CMS security team ranked this 8 with CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H Credit goes to Anna for reporting on HackerOne - https://hackerone.com/reports/1482520
* Remediated CVE-2022-30117 -  Concrete CMS version 9.0.2 and below and 8.5.7 and below allowed traversal in  /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload which could result in an Arbitrary File Delete exploit. This was remediated by sanitizing  /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload to ensure Concrete doesn’t allow traversal and by changing isFullChunkFilePresent to have an early false return when input doesn't match expectations.Concrete CMS Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H. Credit to Siebene for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1482280
* Remediated CVE-2022-30120 - XSS in /dashboard/blocks/stacks/view_details/ -  old browsers only.  When using an older browser with built-in XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are output can be exploited for Concrete CMS version 9.02 and below and Concrete CMS 8.5.7 to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Dashboard Stacks page sort URLs are now sanitized. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 3.1 with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Sanitation has been added where built urls are output. Credit to Bogdan Tiron from FORTBRIDGE (https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/ ) for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1363598
* Remediated CVE-2022-30119 - XSS in /dashboard/reports/logs/view -  old browsers only.  When using Internet Explorer with the XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are output can be exploited for Concrete CMS version 9.02 and below and Concrete CMS 8.5.7 to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 2 with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Sanitation has been added where built urls are output. Thanks zeroinside for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1370054
* Remediated CVE-2022-30118 - XSS in /dashboard/system/express/entities/forms/save_control/[GUID]: \  old browsers only.
When using Internet Explorer with the XSS protection disabled, editing a form control in an express entities form for Concrete CMS version 9.02 and below and Concrete CMS 8.5.7 and below can allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 2 with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Thanks zeroinside for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1370054

If a group is granted "view" permissions on the bulkupdate page, then users in that group can escalate to being an administrator with a specially crafted curl.  Fixed by adding a bulk update permission security check. Concrete CMS Security team CVSS scoring: 7.1 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  Credit for discovery: "Adrian Tiron from FORTBRIDGE ( https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/ )" This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0

* Fixed CVE-2021-22951: “Unauthorized individuals could view password protected files using view_inline”. Concrete CMS now checks to see if a file has a password in view_inline and if it does we don’t render the file. Concrete CMS security team CVSS scoring is 5.3  AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Credit for discovery: "Solar Security Research Team". This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Follow up fix for CVE-2021-40107: Stored XSS in comment section/FileManger via "view_inline" option.  We were informed the fix put into version 8.5.6 was not sufficient. Thanks "Solar Security Research Team". We now check to see if a file has a password in view_inline and, if it does, we don’t render the file. Concrete CMS security team CVSS scoring is 5.3:  AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22967: insecure indirect object reference (IDOR); an unauthenticated user was able to access restricted files by attaching them to a message in a conversation. To remediate this, we added a check to see if a user has permissions to view files before attaching the files to a message in "add / edit message”. The Concrete CMS security team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 4.3 AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Thanks Adrian H for reporting! This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22969 : SSRF mitigation bypass using DNS Rebind attack giving an attacker the ability to fetch cloud IAAS (ex AWS) IAM keys. To fix this, Concrete CMS no longer allows downloads from the local network and specifies the validated IP when downloading  rather than relying on DNS. The Concrete CMS team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.5 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N . Discoverer: Adrian Tiron from FORTBRIDGE (https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/ ) Please note that Cloud IAAS provider mis-configurations are not Concrete CMS vulnerabilities. A mitigation for this vulnerability is to make sure that the IMDS configurations are according to a cloud provider's best practices. This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
* Fixed CVE-2021-22970: Concrete allowed local IP importing causing the system to be vulnerable to a. SSRF attacks on the private LAN servers and b. SSRF Mitigation Bypass through DNS Rebinding. Concrete now disabes all local IPs through the remote file uploading interface. Concrete CMS security team gave this a CVSS v3.1  score of 3.5 AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N This CVE is shared with HackerOne Reports #1364797 (Thanks Adrian Tiron from FORTBRIDGE (https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/ ) and #1360016 (Thanks Bipul Jaiswal) This fix is also in Concrete v 9.0.1

## Backward Compatibility Notes
 
* +* Added protected properties to class `Concrete\Core\Application\UserInterface\Menu\Item\Item` in order to avoid accessing undefined properties and optimize memory usage (See: https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/5307)
* If you have done any Express Form customizations for custom rendering, you will need to update your customizations – there is a new way of performing these customizations that gives greater flexibility and reduces the need for custom templates and spaghetti code. Please check out the Express Form Documentation: [Express Form Theming](https://documentation.concrete5.org/developers/express/express-forms-controllers/form-theming/overview)
* If you have a custom form template for the “express_form” block, you will have to remove the line that looks similar to this at the top of the view template:
    $renderer = Core::make('Concrete\Core\Express\Form\StandardFormRenderer', ['form' => $expressForm]);
* IMPORTANT: If you use the “Manual Approve” method of handling user activations, this option has changed to use User workflows. Add a workflow to the “Activate User” permission to the “Dashboard > System > Permissions > Users” page. This will force users to go through workflow prior to them being approved after registration. **Registration has been disabled on your site!** Once you’ve setup workflow, re-enable user registration from the Dashboard.
